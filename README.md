# SIT323 4.1P - Calculator Microservice

# This microservice was developed as part of the SIT323 Cloud Native Application Development unit. It provides basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) via simple HTTP GET requests using Node.js and Express.

## Project Structure

- `index.js`: The main application file containing route definitions and logic.
- `package.json`: Lists project dependencies and metadata.
- `node_modules/`: Installed dependencies (auto-generated by npm).

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or create your project directory:

   Place the project files in your desired location.

2. Install dependencies:

   Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   This will install Express as defined in `package.json`.

3. Run the server:

   ```
   node index.js
   ```

   If successful, you should see:

   ```
   Calculator microservice running at http://localhost:3000
   ```

## API Endpoints

All endpoints use the HTTP GET method and accept two query parameters: `num1` and `num2`.

- Addition
  ```
  GET /add?num1=5&num2=3
  Response: { "result": 8 }
  ```

- Subtraction
  ```
  GET /subtract?num1=10&num2=4
  Response: { "result": 6 }
  ```

- Multiplication
  ```
  GET /multiply?num1=7&num2=6
  Response: { "result": 42 }
  ```

- Division
  ```
  GET /divide?num1=20&num2=4
  Response: { "result": 5 }
  ```

## Error Handling

The service performs basic validation to ensure clean and meaningful responses:

- If either `num1` or `num2` is missing or not a valid number, a 400 response is returned:
  ```
  Invalid numbers
  ```

- If a division by zero is attempted:
  ```
  Cannot divide by zero
  ```

## Notes

- This project uses Express to simplify route handling and server creation.
- All input is handled via query parameters for simplicity. No body payloads are expected.
- The microservice listens on port 3000 by default.
